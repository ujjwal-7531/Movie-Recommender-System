## MOVIE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

## Overview
This project is a movie recommender system built using Streamlit. It suggests movies based on user preferences, aiming to provide personalized movie recommendations. The goal is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly application.


## Features
 1> Personalized Recommendations: Get movie suggestions based on user inputs 

 2>Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and engaging user experience

## Understanding Recommender Systems:
Learned the fundamentals of how recommender systems work and the different approaches such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.


## Streamlit for Web Applications:
 Gained hands-on experience with Streamlit, a powerful tool for creating interactive web applications in Python.


## Data Processing and Analysis: 
Improved skills in data cleaning, processing, and analysis to ensure accurate and relevant recommendations.


## User Interface Design: 
Enhanced my ability to design intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that improve the overall user experience.

                Techniques used  
                1>Stemming
                2>Removing Stop Words
                4>TOKENIZATION 
                3>Bag of Words Technique
                4>Cosine Similarity Score






Stemming: Applied stemming to reduce words to their base or root form, improving the consistency of text data.


Removing Stop Words: Removed common stop words to reduce noise and focus on the significant words in the dataset.



Bag of Words Technique: Utilized the bag of words technique to convert text data into numerical format, enabling the application of machine learning algorithms.


Cosine Similarity Score: Employed cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies based on their textual features, enhancing the accuracy of recommendations.


## Project Management:
 Developed better project management skills by organizing code, managing dependencies, and maintaining clear documentation.
